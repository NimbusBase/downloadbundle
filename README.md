#Attaching the source

There is two ways to attach the source, first is linking it via

> <script src="http://nimbusbase.com/static/nimbus.min.js"></script>

This is the recommended method so we are able to update your library with our newest changes.

The second is linking from the source library that is attached to this download. This works better for offline apps (mobile/chrome) and if you want to stablize your version
